I have recorded the data released by the "Direção Geral de Saúde" (DGS) on the confirmed cases of COVID-19 per counties in Portugal, and I have constructed this plot, in which, we can see how the spread of the virus is imminent. March 23 is the first day of registration, although before that there were some counties with several confirmed cases (> 3). Note that these data refer to 75% ~ 80% of all confirmed.
