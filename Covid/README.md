I have recorded the data released by the "Direção Geral de Saúde" (DGS) on the confirmed cases of COVID-19 per counties in Portugal, and I have constructed this plot, in which, we can see how the spread of the virus is imminent. March 23 is the first day of registration, although before that there were some counties with several confirmed cases (> 3). Note that these data refer to 75% ~ 80% of all confirmed.

In the previous map we see how COVID-19 quickly spread over the Portugal country. This time, we see how the population in each county influences the spread! It is to be expected that the coastline being the most populous has more confirmed cases. However, we can also see that some areas of the interior, have a number considered infected in relation to their population.
